# Energy-Efficient SRAM Designs: A Comparison of 6T and 8T SRAM Cells

## **About the Project**
This project explores the design and analysis of two types of **SRAM cells**: the conventional **6T SRAM cell** and a newly proposed **8T SRAM cell**. The key focus of the study is to address the **leakage currents** that arise in **unselected rows** during write operations. The proposed **8T SRAM cell** introduces additional transistors that help mitigate these leakage issues, ensuring a more balanced leakage profile and offering improvements in **power efficiency** and **reliability**. Both SRAM designs are simulated and analyzed using advanced **7nm FinFET technology**, focusing on aspects like **leakage current**, **speed**, **power consumption**, and overall **functionality** in reading and writing data. The results highlight the advantages of the **8T SRAM** design in terms of energy efficiency, while also considering trade-offs in terms of **complexity** and **performance**.

## **Inspiration Behind This Project**
With the rapid progression of **nanoscale** technologies, modern computing systems demand memory designs that are both **reliable** and **energy-efficient**.
